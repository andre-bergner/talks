Some Interesting Phenomena in Nonlinear Oscillators



--- Abstract ---

The world of sound and music is crucially depending on systems governed by strong nonlinear interactions.
However, little is known about nonlinear phenomena in the audio and music community, despite the fact that
research is done since over a century ago. In this presentation I will give a quick introduction into the
field of nonlinear dynamics. I will explain two nonlinear phenomena which are ubiquitous in nature and such
in the area of sound as well.

The first is synchronization of oscillatory systems. I will provide some easy math to explain the abstract
form of this effect and how and why this occurs. I will demonstrate it with coupled Moog filters. As an second
example for an nonlinear phenomena I will to explain and demonstrate nonlinear resonance and hysteresis for
a simple nonlinear filter.

In the context of these nonlinear effects I will explain the general concept of bifurcation – a fundamental
property of nonlinear systems only. Further I will demonstrate the nonlinear phenomena with some interactive
audio application.
